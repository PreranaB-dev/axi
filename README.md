                      IMPLEMENTATION OF AXI 3 Protocol
                      
This is the AXI 3 protocol implementation.Initially started with rtl for master and 
slave supporting fixed burst mode with non cacheable and non bufferable single transaction.
The rtl are coded in system verilog.RTL are yet to be compiled and tested with the provided testbench.
Working on developing rtl for supporting other defined modes and transactions.
We will be very happy to receive any kind of feedback regarding our implementation.
